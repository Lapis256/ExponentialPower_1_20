![How to craft Ender Generator](https://github.com/MoSadie/ExponentialPower/blob/master/pictures/EnderGeneratorRecipie.PNG) <-- Ender Generator
## How to use
 After crafting the Ender Generator, you can place it in the world and it will automatically start generating RF. The Ender Cell used in the generator's crafting recipe is tied to the generator and cannot be removed. You can add more Ender Cells, up to 64, which exponentially increases the RF the generator produces.
