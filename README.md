# ExponentialPower
[![Build Status](https://github.com/MoSadie/ExponentialPower/workflows/Gradle%20Build%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MoSadie/ExponentialPower/actions)   [![CurseForge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_254249_downloads.svg)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/exponential-power)

Exponential Power adds a few overpowered late-game power generation and storage options.

## Generators
There are two tiers of generators:
- Ender Generators can generate up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 RF/t
- Advanced Ender Generators can generate up to 1.79e308 RF/t (That number has 292 **zeroes**!)

## Fuel
The generators are fueled using crafted Ender Cells, with the number of cells exponentially affecting how much RF/t is generated!
These Ender Cells are not used up in the process, allowing for a constantly growing source of exponential power as you get more cells.

## Storage
Now the generators generate a lot of power, so being able to store all that power is important.

That's why there's also two tiers of RF storage available!
- Ender Storage can hold 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 RF
- Advanced Ender Storage can hold 1.79e308 RF


## Config Options
If you feel these are too overpowered for your use, don't worry! There are multiple server-side configuration options available:
- Configure the base of the exponent used to calculate power generation, per generator tier
- Configure how many Ender Cells are required to reach the maximum power generation, per generator tier
- Configure how much storage the storage blocks can hold, per storage tier

## Modpacks
Yes, as long as you follow the [license](https://github.com/MoSadie/ExponentialPower/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

(Optional) Tell me all about it as well! I love seeing what people do with my mods.
