![How to craft Ender Generator](https://github.com/MoSadie/ExponentialPower/blob/master/pictures/EnderGeneratorRecipie.PNG) <-- Ender Generator
## How to use
 After crafting the Ender Generator, you can place it in the world and after you add Ender Cells it will automatically start generating MF.   You can add more Ender Cells, up to 64, which exponentially increases the RF the generator produces.
